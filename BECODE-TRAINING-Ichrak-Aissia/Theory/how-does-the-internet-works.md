# How does the Internet works?
## What is Internet?
Misconception: "Internet is a buble cloud" --> Not true, **Internet** is a *wire*.
It is useful because any computer connected on the internet can communicate with other connected computers.

## What is a server?
A **server** is a *special computer* connected directly on the internet.
- Has a unique IP adress.
- ! Our computers are not servers! Because they are not directly connected to the internet

## "Clients":
Computers used by individuals are called **"client"**. They are connected indirectly to internet through an ISP (internet service provider) and a DSL.

## How does information travel?
1. When I send an email (with a gmail adress for instance) it goes to Gmail server and then it will be sent to the server on which the receiver is connected.
Information is sent in smaller pieces. Example, a picture will not be sent all at once but in smaller pieces.

2. Two people working on the same ISP: Can my work end in someone elses computer?
No thanks to the IP and routers (which direct your info on the internet so it reaches its destination)

3. Sending an info is like sending a packet. every time it crosses a routers or server it will be wrapped in a layer and then when the info comes back it wil lose a layer. That way it makes sure it follows the same way back and forth.
